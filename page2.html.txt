        <h1>Uniqueness of Equilibrium and Dynamics of Learning with Price Manipulation</h1>
        <p>Abstract: This paper examines the Chakraborty and Yilmaz (2004) model of dynamic trading by an informed trader and investigates the uniqueness of equilibrium. In our model, the informed trader understands the effect of current trades on future prices and future trading profits, thus has an incentive to decrease the rate at which the market learns her private information. We demonstrate how the informed trader's strategy affects market learning of her private information, both theoretically and computationally.</p>
