## Price manipulation, dynamic informed trading, and the uniqueness of equilibrium in sequential trading 
This paper is authored by Dr Shino Takayama and was published in 2021 in the Journal of Economic Dynamics & Control (JEDC). It studies the manipulation of prices in a dynamic version of the Glosten and Milgrom (1985) model with a long-lived informed trader.

## The uniqueness of equilibrium and dynamics of learning with price manipulation
This paper examines the Chakraborty and Yilmaz (2004) model of dynamic trading by an informed trader and investigates the uniqueness of equilibrium. In our model, the informed trader understands the effect of current trades on future prices and future trading profits, so she has an incentive to decrease the rate at which the market learns her private information.  We demonstrate how the informed trader's strategy affects market learning of her private information, both theoretically and computationally.
