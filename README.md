# Shino Research website

This repository documents two research projects from the School of Economics at the University of Queensland (UQ).  
The first is called
## Price manipulation, dynamic informed trading, and the uniqueness of equilibrium in sequential trading
by Dr Shino Takayama. 
The second project is called '' by Dr Yuqing Liu. 
This website itself is created by the research assistant, Guan-Jia Huang.

## How To
In the same way you keep your pages and assets in one
directory and subdirectories on the server, it is 
the same thing on GitHub Pages through a GitHub repository.

For a user, `<username>.github.io` is the pattern by default
so that GitHub Pages can build the site. Meaning, you should 
create a repository named after this pattern, 
so mine is `xdvrx1.github.io`. 
My site will be automatically created. 
However, you may skip initializing your root directory.

A default document will be displayed when a visitor requests
the site's URL. This is the `index.htm` file (or `index.html`
to make sure other platforms will read it correctly)
unless you change this manually for the server to give
a different default document.
It is the same in GitHub Pages plus the `README.md`
or `index.md`.
So, when you create a repo for GitHub Pages,
you may have one default document from the three options:

- `index.htm` or `index.html`
- `README.md`
- `index.md`

When you create a subdirectory,
they are still the choices for the 
default document. The big advantage of using pure HTML
is the freedom to design your page.

There are three places where GitHub Pages will be building
your site from: `main`, `gh-pages` or `/docs`. 

- Using the `main`
branch, there is no additional effort, 
just set the proper configuration in `Settings`. 

- `gh-pages` is a branch, 
to create this, go to `Branch`,
type in the box 'gh-pages'
then click the pop-up so that
it will be created.

- `/docs` is a subfolder of the main `branch`, 
just click `Create new file` then type 
'docs/index.htm' or any of the other
choices for the default document.
GitHub does not allow empty repository, 
so you must initialize it with a file.
In this example, that is `index.htm`. 

Furthermore, as I have observed when using just a regular
account and when there is no need to change the domain name,
it's just a matter of preference and technique where you
will be building your site among the three options.

But there are few considerations:
- First, the `main` branch can be the source when it's all
about building the site.

- Second, the `gh-pages` can be your choice when your `main`
branch is dedicated for your source codes. 

- Third, the `/docs` folder is a good choice when
you want to build your site from scratch where
you don't copy the contents of the `main` branch,
as in the case of `gh-pages` branch.

Changing the default address is another story, where
you really want to make sure that you 
have an existing domain. If you know how to host 
a site from your computer,
this will be very easy for you to do. So, 
if you don't know the process yet, you find time
studying how to host a website from a different source
because the idea is the same in GitHub Pages.
I provided the link at the bottom.

The themes provided by GitHub Pages can be used
for your pages. These themes will 
always work in Markdown files
but when you deal with pure HTML, make sure
that you always delete the head section and just include
the body so that the theme you selected will
be the one to take care of your page/s.

Then tell Jekyll that through

```
---
layout: default
---
```

on top of the HTML file.

> So, the steps are:
>
> 1. Create a GitHub account if there is none.
>
> 2. Create a repository or use an existing one.
For free accounts, GitHub does not allow you
to host from a private repo.
>
> 3. Go to `Settings` and look for GitHub Pages
at the left side, it's just `Pages`.
>
> 4. Select where GitHub Pages should build 
the pages, either from:

>       - `main` (default)
>       - `gh-pages`
>       - `/docs`
>
> 5. And select a theme also if you want.
>
> 6. You visit the site provided. You now have your web page.
