<h1>Price manipulation, dynamic informed trading, and the uniqueness of equilibrium in sequential trading</h1>
<div id="Intro"></div>
    <h2></h2>
    <p> Manipulation has long been an economic focus of financial markets. Price manipulation refers to the act and attempt of market participants to interface with the functioning of the market and create the artificial and misleading appearance of the market prices. 
According to Allen and Gale (1992), there are three categories of price manipulation: the action-based manipulation, the information-based manipulation, and the trade-based manipulation. The third type is the most difficult to analyze and eradicate.

This webpage will present the numerical program that was used to simulate trading and to study manipulation. 

<h3>Simulation Codes</h3>

    <p>MATLAB code is used and explanations for the functions within the files can be found in readme.txt.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1.<i>mainprog.m</i>: This program solves the equilibrium.</li>
      <li>2.<i>plotfig.m</i>: This program produces pictures from the result (**.mat)</li>
      <li>3. <i>savere.m</i>: This program saves the simulation results.</li>
      <li>4. <i>jactry.m</i>: This program is used to check the bug whenever any issue arises.</li>
