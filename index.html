    <p>The full published paper can be accessed through this link: <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/qld/uq2004/621.html">full paper</a>There you can read the full model and the theoretical results</p>
This webpage will describe the computation procedure that elaborates the approach of studying manipulation. It will also illustrate the results from the simulations.

<h3>Simulation Codes</h3>
    <p>MATLAB code is used and explanations for the functions within the files can be found in readme.txt.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1.<i>mainprog.m</i>: This program solves the equilibrium.</li>
      <li>2.<i>plotfig.m</i>: This program produces pictures from the result (**.mat)</li>
      <li>3. <i>savere.m</i>: This program saves the simulation results.</li>
      <li>4. <i>jactry.m</i>: This program is used to check the bug whenever any issue arises.</li>
