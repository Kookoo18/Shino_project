    <h2></h2>
    <p> This paper proposes a theoretical model to study informed investors' manipulative trading. The model builds upon Glosten and Milgrom (1985), with its dynamics similar to Back and Baruch (2004) but in discrete time. The main results are 
(1) a set of sufficient conditions to guarantee the uniqueness of a Markov equilibrium;
(2) how the existence of multiple equilibria relates to the number of remaining trading rounds; and
(3) a numerical program to simulate trading and to study manipulation
        The full published paper can be accessed through this link: <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/qld/uq2004/621.html">full paper</a>There you can read the full model and the theoretical results</p>
This webpage will describe the computation procedure that elaborates the approach of studying manipulation. It will also illustrate the results from the simulations.
